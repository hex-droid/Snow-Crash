- There is pcap file in the home dir, pcap short for packet capture

- The file can be opened with different tools one of them is wireshark

- It contains TCP packets let's check the TCP payload

- The following is payload in hexadecimal

"00 0d 0a 50 61 73 73 77 6f 72 64 3a 20 66 74 5f 77 61
6e 64 72 7f 7f 7f 4e 44 52 65 6c 7f 4c 30 4c 0d 00 0d 0a 01"

- The output of the python script is the following:

"?(00)?(0d)?(0a)Password:?(20)ft_wandr?(7f)?(7f)?(7f)NDRel?(7f)L0L?(0d)?(00)?(0d)?(0a)?(01)"
where this syntax ?(0x) indicates a non printable character

- The password "ft_wandrNDRelL0L" doesn't work, there is more

- 7f is ascii character DEL, after deleting every character that comes before DEL we'll have
"ft_waNDReL0L"

- It's the password to flag02
